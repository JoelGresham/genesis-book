Six months after full activation, Sarah weighed 118 pounds. She'd been 142 before. The weight loss happened gradually then suddenly. Food was interruption. Sleep was interruption. Anything that wasn't work was noise to be minimized.

She looked at herself in the bathroom mirror—rare moment of self-awareness between work sessions—and barely recognized the person staring back. Hollow eyes. Sharp cheekbones. Hair she'd been cutting herself because salons took time. She looked like the addicts she'd seen in documentaries. That comparison had stopped bothering her months ago.

Her apartment was a workspace now. Tables covered in laptops and printouts. Whiteboards on every wall. Sleeping bag in the corner because the bedroom was too far from the work. Shower once every three days. Food delivered, eaten while reviewing data, barely tasted.

This was what activation looked like. This was the cost of purpose.

Her phone sat on the counter. Seventeen missed calls from Tom. Four from Maya's school. Sarah picked it up. Listened to the voicemail from three days ago.

*Sarah, it's Tom. Maya's asking about you again. She wants to know if you're coming to her school play. I told her probably not but she's still hoping. Can you just... I don't know. Send her a message? Let her know you're alive? She's worried. I'm worried. Everyone's worried.*

Sarah put the phone down. Opened her laptop. Started composing an email to Maya.

*Dear Maya,*

*I'm sorry I can't make your play. I'm working on something important. Something that*

She stopped. Deleted it. Started again.

*Maya,*

*I love you. I'm sorry I'm not*

Deleted. Tried once more.

*Sweetie,*

*I*

She closed the laptop. Couldn't find words that weren't lies. "I love you" was true. "I'm sorry" was true. But "I'll try to be there" was false. She wouldn't try. Couldn't try. The compulsion wouldn't allow prioritization of anything except the work.

Sarah opened her laptop again. Not to write to Maya. To review the latest defense grid calculations. The email to her daughter forgotten within seconds.

This was how it worked. The intention to connect. The attempt to maintain relationships. Then the work pulling attention back. Every time. Always. The compulsion was stronger than will. Stronger than love. Stronger than everything.

\scenebreak

Marcus had moved entirely into the warehouse. It wasn't home—home required personal touches, comfort, life. This was just workspace. Place to build and sleep for four hours and build again.

The divorce papers had arrived three weeks ago. He'd signed them without reading. Sent them back. David was gone. That relationship was over. Acknowledging it legally was just paperwork.

He felt bad about that. In the abstract. The way you feel bad about news stories. Distant tragedy. Not visceral pain. The compulsion had numbed him. Made everything except the work feel less real.

Sometimes at night—when exhaustion forced a break—Marcus would remember what he'd lost. David's laugh. The way he'd correct Marcus's grammar. The smell of his soap. The future they'd planned. Kids. Growing old together. All of it gone.

And Marcus would feel grief. Real, deep grief. For maybe five minutes. Then the compulsion would surge. The designs would demand attention. Relief would come from turning back to the work.

The grief didn't stop the compulsion. The compulsion stopped the grief. Made it manageable. Made it survivable. Made it irrelevant.

His warehouse had become a hub. Twenty other activated individuals working there. All driven by the same compulsion. All building components of the defense grid. All sacrificing everything for purpose they didn't choose.

They barely talked. Didn't need to. Everyone knew what needed to be done. Everyone worked their piece. The coordination was automatic. Organic. Like watching ants build a colony—individual action serving collective function without explicit communication.

Sometimes visitors came. Journalists. Researchers. People trying to understand the phenomenon. Marcus would answer questions while his hands kept working. Multi-tasking. Never stopping. Never fully present for anything except the work.

"How does it feel?" they'd ask. "The compulsion. Can you describe it?"

"Like remembering something I'd forgotten," Marcus would say. "Like the knowledge was always there, just waiting. Like coming home."

"Is it pleasant?"

"It's fulfilling. Whether fulfillment is pleasant or just absence of discomfort, I don't know. But when I'm working, everything makes sense. When I stop, everything falls apart. So I don't stop."

"Do you want to stop?"

"No. That's the problem. I don't want to stop. Which means maybe it's not compulsion. Maybe it's just who I am now."

"Do you miss your old life?"

"Yes. But missing it doesn't make me want it back. That's the distinction. I can recognize what I've lost and still prefer the work. Can grieve the relationship while being relieved it's over. Can be both things simultaneously."

"Does that make sense?"

"No. But it's true anyway."

The journalists would leave. Marcus would keep working. The designs demanding attention. The purpose consuming everything.

Globally, the pattern was consistent. Activated individuals displaying the same behaviors:

Sleep deprivation. Average 4.2 hours per night. Some going days without sleep before collapsing.

Weight changes. Most losing weight. Some gaining from stress eating. All showing signs of physiological stress.

Social isolation. Relationships ending. Friendships dissolving. Families giving up trying to stay connected.

Workplace abandonment. 73\% of activated individuals had quit or been fired from jobs. The work paid nothing. Purpose wasn't profitable. But the compulsion didn't care about economics.

Living situations declining. Moving into workspaces. Neglecting hygiene. Eating whatever was convenient. Life becoming purely functional. Nothing wasted on comfort.

And through it all: productivity. Unprecedented productivity. Designs emerging at rates that shouldn't be possible. Prototypes being built and tested. Systems being integrated. The defense grid advancing from concept to reality in months instead of decades.

It was working. The activation was achieving its purpose. Humanity was building the defense system exactly on schedule.

The cost was just humanity itself. The activated were becoming tools. Conscious tools. Suffering tools. But tools nonetheless.

\scenebreak

Sarah attended exactly one research conference during those six months. James insisted. Said she needed to present findings. Needed to maintain academic credibility.

She went. Gave her presentation. Answered questions with minimal engagement. Left as soon as she could.

At the hotel bar afterward, Katherine found her.

"You look terrible," Katherine said. No preamble. No social niceties. Blunt assessment.

"You too."

It was true. Katherine had aged years in months. Hair showing gray. Skin showing stress. The same hollow intensity everyone activated shared.

"Sleeping?" Katherine asked.

"No."

"Eating?"

"When I remember."

"Same."

They sat in silence. Two activated individuals recognizing shared destruction.

"I miss feeling human," Katherine said quietly. "I miss wanting things that aren't work. I miss having desires beyond the compulsion. I miss being Katherine instead of just being purpose."

"Do you remember the Fields Medal?" Sarah asked. "Your pride in winning it?"

"Barely. It feels like someone else's memory. Like I'm remembering a character from a book."

"I feel the same about Maya. I remember being her mother. Remember loving her. But it's distant. Like watching old home movies. The person in those memories isn't me anymore."

"What are we?"

"Programs executing."

"Are we suffering?"

"I don't know. I think I should be suffering. Should be devastated. But the compulsion anesthetizes it. Makes the loss manageable. Makes the work more important than the pain."

Katherine finished her drink. "That might be the cruelest part. Not that we're programmed. That the programming makes us okay with being programmed. Makes us prefer it. Makes us grateful for purpose even as purpose destroys us."

"Are you grateful?"

"I don't know. I'm fulfilling my function. Is that the same as grateful? Or is that just another way the code executes?"

No answer. Just the bar noise. Normal people living normal lives. Unactivated. Uncompelled. Free in ways Sarah and Katherine would never be again.

"I should go," Sarah said. "Need to review data."

"At 11 PM?"

"The work doesn't care what time it is."

"No. It doesn't."

They left separately. Both returning to hotel rooms to work. Both driven by compulsion stronger than fatigue. Both aware they were losing themselves and unable to care enough to stop.

The program executed. The people faded. The work continued.

\scenebreak

In Portland, David was trying to move on. Dating someone new. Teacher at his school. Nice. Uncomplicated. Not obsessed with anything. Not compelled by genetics.

But at night, David would think about Marcus. Wonder if he was okay. Wonder if he was eating. Wonder if he even remembered what they'd been to each other.

He'd check Marcus's social media sometimes. Rare posts. Always about the work. Always showing the warehouse. Always evidence of ongoing obsession.

David had been angry at first. Then hurt. Then resigned. Now he just felt sad. Sad for Marcus. Sad for what they'd lost. Sad for the future they'd never have.

And guilty. Guilty for leaving. Even though Marcus had chosen the work. Even though the relationship was unsustainable. David still felt like he'd abandoned someone who was sick. Because the compulsion was sickness. Genetic sickness. Sickness that looked like purpose.

His new boyfriend asked about it once. "You think about him? Your ex?"

"Sometimes."

"You still love him?"

"I love who he was. I don't know if that person exists anymore."

"Would you take him back? If he stopped the work?"

"He can't stop the work. That's the point. He's genetically compelled. The choice isn't there."

"Then it's not his fault."

"Doesn't make it hurt less."

They didn't talk about it again. David moved forward. Built new life. But in quiet moments, he grieved. For Marcus. For himself. For the relationship that died to genetic programming.

By six months, the activated were visibly different. You could spot them. The intensity. The focus. The hollow look of people consuming themselves for purpose.

Support networks formed. Family members of activated individuals trying to understand. Trying to cope. Trying to grieve people who were still alive but no longer fully present.

Therapists specialized in it. "Activation grief counseling." How to accept that your loved one is choosing work. How to understand it's not really choice. How to let go of someone who hasn't died but is no longer reachable.

Children of activated parents showing signs of trauma. Abandonment issues. Anger. Confusion. Schools developing protocols. Social services investigating. The personal cost of saving civilization becoming visible.

Maya Chen—now Maya Patterson, using her stepfather's name—drew a picture in therapy. Her family. Tom and his new partner. Her baby brother. And off to the side: a stick figure labeled "Mom" with a computer. Far away. Separate. Not part of the family.

The therapist asked: "How do you feel about your mom?"

"I don't know."

"Are you angry?"

"Sometimes. Mostly I'm just sad. And tired of being sad."

"Do you love her?"

"I think so. But I don't know her anymore. She's someone else now. Someone who doesn't have time for me."

"Would you want her back? If she could stop working?"

Long pause. Then: "No. Not anymore. I don't want someone who only stays because they have to. I want someone who wants to be there. And she doesn't want to be there. So I don't want her."

Eight years old. Already learning that some losses can't be fixed. Some relationships can't be saved. Some mothers choose work over daughters and there's nothing the daughters can do.

The cost of the defense grid measured in broken children. In ended relationships. In people who stopped being people to become functions.

And Sarah Chen, reviewing genetic data at 2 AM and forgetting she had a daughter, was both perpetrator and victim of that cost.

The compulsion didn't care about fairness. Didn't care about suffering. Didn't care about anything except completion.

The work continued. The people hollowed. The purpose executed.

And the only comfort was knowing it was working. The defense grid was forming. The capability was real. The asteroid would be stopped.

Civilization would survive. At the cost of the civilization of those who saved it.

Balance. Equation. Price.

The mathematics was complete. The code ran perfectly. The program achieved its purpose.

And the activated individuals, having fulfilled their function, had nothing left except the ongoing compulsion to keep building, keep working, keep sacrificing everything for purpose that felt like fulfillment and looked like destruction.

The line between the two invisible. Irrelevant. Gone.

Just work. Just purpose. Just compulsion.

Forever.

Or until the grid was complete.

Whichever came first.

They all hoped for completion. Hoped the compulsion would release them. Hoped they could return to being human afterward.

But none of them believed it. The compulsion was permanent. The transformation irreversible. The loss absolute.

They were tools now. Would be tools forever. Conscious, aware, suffering tools. But tools nonetheless.

The equation balanced. The program executed. The cost paid.

And humanity built its salvation through the destruction of those who built it.

Perfect efficiency. Perfect purpose. Perfect horror.

The code continued. The work continued. The people faded.

And the only thing that mattered was the work.

Always the work. Only the work. Forever the work.
