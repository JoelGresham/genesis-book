## Overview

*The Genesis Code* tells the story of intelligent dinosaurs who, facing extinction 65 million years ago, encoded humanity's entire technological progression into DNA—making every human achievement a pre-programmed activation. When scientists discover the truth, they must grapple with whether free will exists, and whether it matters.
