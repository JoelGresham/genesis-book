1-15)\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nCHAPTER 1: The Watcher\nSketch of elegant dinosaur silhouette gazing upward at dawn sky, three stones arranged in deliberate pattern at feet, peaceful clearing, side view, scientific illustration style\n\nCHAPTER 2: The Communities  \nMultiple dinosaur figures across a landscape, each engaged in different precise behaviors, stone patterns, cliff carvings, distant mountains, birds-eye view diagram, connecting lines between locations\n\nCHAPTER 3: The Gathering\nHundreds of dinosaur silhouettes arranged in geometric pattern, all facing same direction, three-day vigil, mesa gathering place, minimal detail, pattern emphasis\n\nCHAPTER 4: The New Star\nDinosaur frozen in stillness looking at night sky, new point of light visible, mathematical calculation symbols floating around head, thought bubble style, contemplative pose\n\nCHAPTER 5: The Patterns Emerge\nClose-up of dinosaur claws arranging complex stone pattern, massive timeline spreading across ground, another figure in background bringing food, work-in-progress diagram\n\nCHAPTER 6: The Protectors\nDinosaur observing small mammal using stick tool, protective stance, nest visible, two-day stillness indicated by moon phases, patient watching, scientific observation style\n\nCHAPTER 7: The Mathematics [CRITICAL]\nDinosaur standing over fallen companion, three stones moved, work continues around the body, stark composition, grief through action, no sentimentality, archaeological site feeling\n\nCHAPTER 8: The Acceleration  \nAsteroid visible as small disk in sky, dinosaur in month-long stillness, time-lapse indication, multiple mammal generations, urgency building, calendar marks\n\nCHAPTER 9: The Encoding\nAerial view of complete stone timeline with distinct clusters, dinosaur moving between clusters and mammal populations, DNA helix patterns on cliff face, mapping diagram\n\nCHAPTER 10: The Architects [THE REVEAL]\nThree stones arranged in memorial pattern, dinosaur at completed timeline, small mammal with stick in foreground, asteroid filling quarter of sky, moment of completion\n\nCHAPTER 11: The Completion\nMultiple dinosaurs guiding specific mammals to survival territories, each carrying different encoded segments, beautiful calculated precision, distribution map style\n\nCHAPTER 12: The Witness\nYoung dinosaur watching elder work, crude stone imitation nearby, knowledge being passed, no spoken words, learning through observation, generational connection\n\nCHAPTER 13: The Silence  \nAsteroid dominating sky, dinosaurs in strange peace, visiting between territories, mathematical probability floating in thought bubble: 99.7%, quiet acceptance\n\nCHAPTER 14: The Last Gathering\nDinosaur families together at gathering points, two pressed close for warmth, young dinosaur with elder, mammals safely elsewhere, final hours, constellation pattern overhead\n\nCHAPTER 15: The Impact\nDinosaur checking calculations one final time as light approaches, satisfaction not fear, equation balanced, poetic but not graphic, mathematical symbols and light\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nPART TWO: THE INHERITORS (Chapters 16-32)\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nCHAPTER 16: The Sequence\nWoman at computer screen showing DNA sequence at 2 AM, too-regular patterns, fibonacci spirals, phone notification ignored, coffee cup, exhaustion visible, discovery moment\n\nCHAPTER 17: The Correlation\nComputer screen showing timeline: tool use, fire, agriculture clusters, activation markers highlighted, woman's hand trembling on mouse, correlation graphs, phone in other hand\n\nCHAPTER 18: The Historian\nTwo people over ancient timeline map, overlaying genetic data with historical discoveries, Newton and Leibniz simultaneous breakthrough notation, connection lines being drawn\n\nCHAPTER 19: The Genius\nMathematician staring at her own genome sequence, Fields Medal on desk, breakthrough moment deconstructed, \"it just came to me\" caption, identity questioning, mirror reflection\n\nCHAPTER 20: The Network\nBasement lab meeting, dozen researchers, screens showing full genetic code progression, one man answering with exact numbers, whispered concern, secret gathering atmosphere\n\nCHAPTER 21: The Simulation  \nComputer simulation showing planetary defense grid, asteroid trajectory, 65-million-year protection plan revealed, people realizing \"we're tools,\" existential horror in body language\n\nCHAPTER 22: The Activation\nWoman surrounded by intrusive blueprint visions, satellite networks floating in thought bubbles, can't sleep, Maya's photo pushed aside, compulsion overwhelming, loss of control\n\nCHAPTER 23: The Compulsion\nChild crying at lab door while mother works, unable to stop, screens and equations everywhere, man at 4 AM construction site, partner leaving, relationships fracturing, desperate isolation\n\nCHAPTER 24: The Choice\nSmall distant asteroid diagram, 40-year impact projection, woman on phone leaving voicemail, cutting off mid-sentence, returning to work, split between love and compulsion\n\nCHAPTER 25: The Broadcast\nWoman at broadcast setup, \"We are not the authors\" text visible, global reactions on multiple screens, construction continuing regardless, message notification on phone, truth spreading\n\nCHAPTER 26: The Resistance\nActivated woman fighting compulsion, physically ill, shaking hands, two-week calendar marked off, breaking point moment, \"I tried\" thought bubble, inevitable return\n\nCHAPTER 27: The Builder [CRITICAL]\nMan working while screaming, construction accident scene, loss and compulsion simultaneous, stone pattern dream symbols, wedding ring, unable to stop building, parallel to ancient grief\n\nCHAPTER 28: The Philosopher\nTwo people at remote site, working in silence, brief exchange in speech bubbles, capability vs personality debate, high altitude construction, mutual understanding, quiet recognition\n\nCHAPTER 29: The Line [THE LOVE SCENE - CRITICAL]\nCalibration screen showing \"COMPLETE\", two people on floor, cold concrete, confused tangle of need and exhaustion, no romanticism, raw humanity, dawn window light, return to work\n\nCHAPTER 30: The Completion\nPlanetary defense grid complete diagram, asteroid successfully deflected, two people brief reunion, strained mother-daughter relationship, 20-year markers, Maya with children, no resolution\n\nCHAPTER 31: The Message [CRITICAL]\nGenetic code revealing compressed memories, woman reading alone at night, ancient message decoded, \"that wondering might be the only real thing\" text, quiet contemplation\n\nCHAPTER 32: The Question\nElderly woman (78) in interview, reflection over 40 years, granddaughter questioning, photo of remarried man, space travel activation beginning, \"both were real\" realization, wisdom without answers\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nEPILOGUE: THE CYCLE (Chapter 33)\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nCHAPTER 33: The Cycle\nAlien avian scientist on different planet, asteroid in sky, encoding small mammals, mate bringing food, one-day pause after loss, return to calculation, \"The mathematics was complete\" eternal cycle\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\nUSAGE NOTES:\n- These are SKETCH prompts - add the base style from node 3\n- Each creates a simple, clean illustration that hints without spoiling\n- Part 1 (dinosaurs): No dialogue, observational, alien intelligence\n- Part 2 (humans): Intimate, desperate, relationships fracturing\n- Keep minimal shading, thought bubbles for internal concepts\n- Black and white, scientific diagram aesthetic throughout\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━"],
