## 💡 Creative Direction

### Interior Drawings Should Be:
✅ Simple and uncluttered
✅ Scientific but accessible
✅ Sketch-like, almost unfinished
✅ Minimal but meaningful
✅ Black and white
✅ Support the narrative without overwhelming it

❌ Not polished or finished
❌ Not colored
❌ Not complex or busy
❌ Not photorealistic

### Book Cover Should Be:
✅ Mysterious and enticing
✅ Professional and cinematic
✅ Bold color choices
✅ Clear focal point
✅ Hint at the story without spoiling
✅ Stand out on a bookshelf

❌ Not giving away the dinosaur twist (too early)
❌ Not too literal or explanatory
❌ Not cluttered with too many elements
❌ Not amateur or clipart-like

## 🎯 Recommended Generation Process

### Phase 1: Exploration (Interior)
1. Generate 20-30 sketch variations using different prompts
2. Focus on key themes: DNA, dinosaurs, timelines, thought bubbles
3. Try different compositions: portrait, landscape, square
4. Save everything, even failures (might spark ideas)

### Phase 2: Refinement (Interior)
1. Select your top 10 favorites
2. Refine prompts for more control
3. Generate 3-5 variations of each
4. Choose finals for each chapter/section

### Phase 3: Cover Exploration
1. Try all 10 cover concepts from the example prompts
2. Generate 3-5 variations of each concept
3. Review upscaled versions
4. Narrow down to top 3 concepts

### Phase 4: Cover Finalization
1. Refine the top 3 concepts with prompt adjustments
2. Generate multiple seeds to find "the one"
3. Upscale your final choice
4. Add typography in separate software (Photoshop, Canva, etc.)

## 🛠️ Model Recommendations

### Best Quality (High VRAM - 10GB+):
- **Drawings**: Flux.1 Dev + Sketch Illustration LoRA
- **Cover**: DreamShaper XL + Book Cover LoRA

### Good Quality (Medium VRAM - 6-8GB):
- **Drawings**: SDXL Base + Pencil Sketch LoRA
- **Cover**: Deliberate XL (no LoRA needed)

### Lower VRAM (4-6GB):
- Consider SD 1.5 models instead

## 📝 Prompt Writing Tips

### For Sketches:
- Always start with "sketch illustration, simple line art"
- End with "unfinished sketch style, minimal shading, black and white"
- Be specific about the subject in the middle
- Keep it under 50 words
- Focus on one concept per image

### For Covers:
- Start with "book cover design, sci-fi novel"

- Describe composition: central, split, overhead, etc.
- Suggest color palette
- Include "professional book cover, high quality"
- Can be longer (50-75 words)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Out of memory | Reduce resolution, close other apps |
| Model not found | Check file in correct folder, restart ComfyUI |
| Too slow | Use GPU mode, smaller resolution, or different model |
| Colors wrong | Check negative prompts, adjust LoRA strength |
| Too busy/cluttered | Simplify prompt, add negatives, lower CFG |
| Not sketch-like enough | Increase LoRA strength to 0.9-1.0 |
| Cover not bold enough | Increase CFG to 9-10, try different seed |

## ⚖️ Legal & Licensing

Before publishing commercially:

1. **Check Model Licenses**: Each AI model has different terms
   - Flux.1 Dev: Review non-commercial restrictions
   - SDXL: Generally commercial-friendly
   - LoRAs: Check individual creator terms

2. **Consider Attribution**: Some models require credit
3. **Generation Rights**: Generally, you own what you generate, but verify
4. **Review Terms**: Always read the license of models you download

💡 **Pro Tip**: For full commercial confidence, consider:
- Using only commercially-licensed models
- Hiring an artist for final polish
- Using AI as concept/reference generation
